# Individual-Git-Exercise
For INFO 4190 (S50), improving git and github skills.

Added repo using git clone  

## Dictionary Program
Added dictionary.py, using git add  
This programed is designed to prompt the user to input the amount of keys and corresponding values they want to add into the dictonary. The keys and values will be shown once all is entered.  

## Added delete feature branch
git checkout -b feature-delete  
The program now has the feature to delete a key and its corresponding value.  
Made sure to check on github that the branch is there, and merge the branch into the main branch.  

## Added modify feature branch
git checkout -b feature-modify  
The program now has the feature to modify the value of the corresponding key. 
This time used git to merge and commit the branch. Main branch is updated properly locally and on github. 

## Added comments for video  
Added comments into dictionary.py, to explain what the purpose of the features delete and modify do.
